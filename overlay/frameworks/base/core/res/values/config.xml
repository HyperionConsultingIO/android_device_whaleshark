    <!-- If true, the direction rotation is applied to get to an application's requested
         orientation is reversed.  Normally, the model is that landscape is
         clockwise from portrait; thus on a portrait device an app requesting
         landscape will cause a clockwise rotation, and on a landscape device an
         app requesting portrait will cause a counter-clockwise rotation.  Setting
         true here reverses that logic. -->
